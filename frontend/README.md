## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend root directory:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://soniya234-todo.hf.space
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Integration

The application connects to a FastAPI backend at the configured API base URL. All API calls use the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
- `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Get specific task details
- `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` - Update a task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete` - Toggle task completion

## Architecture

- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages
- `src/app/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/app/lib/` - Utility functions and API client
- `src/app/models/` - TypeScript interfaces
- `src/app/contexts/` - React context providers
- `src/app/public/` - Static assets
- `styles/` - Global styles

## Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages with instant switching. The language toggle button in the header allows users to switch between languages, and all text throughout the application updates instantly.
